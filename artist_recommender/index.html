           <p>Twitter is one of the most popular social networking sites in the world,in which users compose their reactions in less than 140 characters .It has currently <b>six million unique visitors</b> every month and <b>55 million monthly visits</b>.It often acts as a platform where celebrities interact with their fans ,hence it's importance in shaping a public opinion cannot be ignored.
           Also ,Twitter is used by music labels for the social media marketing of their music artists.
           In this project ,we attempt to explore behaviors of music on Twitter ,particularly music artists-how music tastes are reflected by Twitter and understanding the demographics of the music artists.For this purpose, we used data supplied by Echonest API -the backbone for the popular "Million Song Dataset".
           We attempted to build a recommender on the basis of data collected using content-based approach.</p>
          <p> In the below map, we attempt to 
           visualise locations of some of the most popular socially active and trending music artists in the world.</p>
